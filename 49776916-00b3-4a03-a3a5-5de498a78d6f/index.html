"I have worked with Carl and Jason on few occasions now and I see them as true partners to the entrepreneur ( and investors in some cases as I have observed ) and they go way beyond their scope in ensuring that first of all the opportunity is fundable and then ensuring it gets funded. Given their diversity across finance and legal gives them an edge combined by a boutique approach to targeted approach rather than carpet bombing"
Anurag Srivastava, Co-Founder/ CEO SpaceMatrixGroup, Co-Founder Jungle Ventures, Co-Founder OneAnimation

No time wasting, within 1-2 months we had held the investor meetings and closed the investment for interested parties. Can't recommend them enough"
Mark Cameron, Co-Founder/ Director, Booktrack

"Carl and Jason are a thoroughly professional team who are always accommodating and helpful. Their connectivity and network is extensive and I have always found them to give excellent advice. I have personally known Carl for almost ten years and he has advised me on many of my investments. I have also known Jason for a couple of years and have worked with both of them on several transactions. I would not hesitate to recommend them."
JM Chanrai, of the Kewalram Chanrai Group

Their excellent network of contacts enables them to punch way above their relatively small size.”
Bharat Dube, Founder/ CEO, SIPI

helped us find the right investor and raise significant capital. He ran the
process very professionally keeping in view both the Investor and Investee's
goals and working closely with both to align them. He is insightful and has
high integrity, yet focusses on getting a positive outcome in specific
period of time. We intend to continue engaging Carl in our future endeavors.”
